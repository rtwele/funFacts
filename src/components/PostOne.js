                <li>Skateboarding is actually considered to have developed from surfing, and was initially known as sidewalk surfing, with the first skateboard being introduced in the year 1950.</li>
                <li>The early wheels on skateboards were made of clay or metal. Polyurethane wheels were not invented until the early 1970s.</li>
                <li>The first skateboards, created in California, had handles to make them easier to handle.</li>
                <li>Prior to the invention of skateboarding ramps, skateboarders would practice in empty swimming pools and in drainage ditches.</li>
